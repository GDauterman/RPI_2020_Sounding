# RPI_BotR_2020_Sounding
This is the repository for RPI's Freshman BotR team, specifically the one competing in the sounding rocket competition.

For structure, we're going to try to keep this relatively straightforward.  
We're not going to do development or personal branches because realistically
we're going to be working on this together in meetings, and we'll be aware
of what other people in the team are working on.

If you want to work on a new idea or structure (something that requires a big
change in the code we already have), make a copy of the file and make it into
a new version (V1.1->V1.2).  

Everyone has pretty much full permissions except deleting the repo, so don't
like yeet the whole ass project accidentally.
